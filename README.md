#Benefits of Using JsonPowerDB
In the world of API craft, no area is more hotly discussed than design. From REST, gRPC, to GraphQL, there are many approaches to designing and standardizing web API interactions. Today we turn our focus to another approach, JSON API, a specification for building APIs detailed at JSONAPI.org.

JSON API, described at JSONAPI.org, is great for making your JSON response formatting more consistent. With the goal being to increase productivity and efficiency, JSON API has been touted for its efficient caching features that can eliminate superfluous server requests.

In this piece, we’ll define what JSON API is, and see how it might be used to build efficient APIs. We’ll introduce some of the main benefits of JSON API, and also peek into case studies at FitBit to see how this specification has been used in practice. Hopefully, this overview will introduce newcomers to JSON API and help you gauge if it’s a right fit for your API scenario.
